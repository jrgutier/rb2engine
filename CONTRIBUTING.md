# Contributing to rb2engine

Thanks for helping. This project converts real DJ libraries; wrong bytes are
worse than missing features. The testing rules below are load-bearing, not
style preference.

## Development setup

Requires **Python 3.11+** and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrgutier/rb2engine
cd rb2engine
uv sync
```

Run the unit suite (default; no hardware required):

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Lint and type-check:

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/
```

Format check (same ruff config as CI):

```bash
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

Install an editable CLI for manual runs:

```bash
uv run rb2engine --help
uv run rb2engine convert --help
```

## Project layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/rb2engine/reader/` | rekordbox USB export → source IR |
| `src/rb2engine/ir.py`, `ir_engine.py` | Decoupling boundary — no cross-imports of side types |
| `src/rb2engine/mapper/` | Semantics (keys, cues, beatgrids, track fields) |
| `src/rb2engine/writer/` | Engine IR → `m.db` (DDL, blobs, tracks, playlists) |
| `src/rb2engine/writer/ddl/` | Engine-authored schema captures — see that README |
| `tests/unit/` | Fast tests; golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` |
| `tests/fixtures/golden/` | **Read-only** Engine-authored artifacts — never overwrite |

## Testing philosophy

These rules exist so a self-consistent-but-wrong encoder cannot ship.

### 1. Blob codecs: byte-identity against Engine

PerformanceData codecs are validated by round-tripping **Engine's own bytes**:

```text
encode(decode(blob)) == blob
```

for `beatData`, `quickCues`, `loops`, and `trackData`, using databases Engine
itself wrote (`tests/fixtures/golden/engine_ref.db` and related fixtures).

A codec that invents a private dialect can still be internally consistent.
Byte-identity against Engine is what makes the encoders trustworthy. If you
change a codec, the golden round-trip must stay green; if Engine changes
framing, capture new golden blobs — do not weaken the gate.

### 2. Never generate expectations from the implementation

**Do not** run your own code and paste the output as the expected value.

Expected values come from only three places:

1. **The specification** (documented format rules, Engine constraints, explicit
   product decisions in code comments / plan)
2. **Engine-authored fixtures** (golden `m.db` files, real pdb slices under
   `tests/fixtures/real_bytes/`)
3. **Hand-authored reasoning** (small constructed inputs where every field is
   justified in the test docstring)

Self-generated expectations are tautological: they only prove the code agrees
with itself. Mutation-test the gate when you can (e.g. flip an endianness
constant and confirm the golden test fails).

### 3. `real_stick` tests need physical hardware

Tests marked `@pytest.mark.real_stick` require a mounted rekordbox USB export
and are **skipped** otherwise (including in CI):

```bash
uv run pytest -m real_stick
```

Do not rewrite them to pass without hardware. Do not commit paths or personal
library metadata from a production stick into fixtures — use the Tier-A
authoring checklist under `tests/fixtures/AUTHORING.md` for committable data.

### 4. Non-destructive guarantee is tested, not asserted

The product promise is: **nothing outside `Engine Library/` may be written**.

That is enforced by tests that walk the drive tree before and after a
conversion (and by related checks that source audio hashes are unchanged after
artwork extraction). If you add a write path, extend those tests. A comment
that says “we never touch `PIONEER/`” is not evidence.

Default report path is under `Engine Library/` so the report itself does not
violate the boundary.

## Schema versions

Unsupported Engine schema triples fail loud. Adding support is a DDL capture
plus one dict entry — step-by-step in
[`src/rb2engine/writer/ddl/README.md`](src/rb2engine/writer/ddl/README.md).

After a capture:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_schema.py -v
```

## Pull requests

1. Keep changes focused. Touch only what the change needs.
2. Prefer tests that encode **why** a behaviour matters (what breaks for a DJ
   if it regresses), not only that today's output matches itself.
3. Run `uv run pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy` before opening the PR.
4. Do not commit secrets, full production libraries, or commercial album art.
5. Do not reformat unrelated files.

## License

Contributions are under the same MIT license as the project (see `LICENSE`).
Runtime dependencies must remain permissively licensed (MIT / BSD). GPL tools
(e.g. mutagen) may be **dev-only** oracles, never imported from `src/`.

## Questions

Open a GitHub issue. For conversion failures on a real stick, attach the
`Engine Library/rb2engine-report.json` (redact paths if needed) and the schema
triple from `Information` if you can read it from a **copy** of `m.db`.
