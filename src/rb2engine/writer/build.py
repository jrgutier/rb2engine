"""Atomic os.replace() of m.db and reconcile(); preserves sibling DBs and Music/.

Safety boundary — this is the ONLY module that writes to the user's stick:

* Write ONLY inside ``<drive>/Engine Library/``. Never touch ``PIONEER/`` or
  ``Contents/``.
* Build ``Database2/m.db.tmp`` in the same directory as ``m.db``, flush +
  fsync, close, then ``os.replace()`` over ``m.db``. Same-directory file
  replace is atomic against process failure on POSIX and Windows.
* PRESERVE everything we do not author: ``hm.db``, ``sm.db``, ``stm.db``,
  ``Music/``, ``Artwork/``, ``OverviewData/``, and any unknown file.
* Carry forward schema triple + ``Information.uuid`` from an existing ``m.db``.
* A stray ``m.db.tmp`` is deleted on startup, never adopted.
* On fatal error: remove ``m.db.tmp``, leave the previous ``m.db`` untouched.
